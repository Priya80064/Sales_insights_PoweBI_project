# Sales_insights_PowerBI_project

Project Objective

AtliQ Hardware, a leading global hardware company specializing in PCs, Printers, Mouse, and Computers, aims to boost sales and improve net gross margins and profits.

The Sales Director has recognized the limitations of static reports and numerous Excel files from regional managers. These formats hinder the discovery of actionable insights. My role as a Data Analyst was to transform this unorganized data into interactive dashboards and meaningful visualizations that reveal key performance indicators (KPIs).


My Goal as a Data Analyst

This project involved analyzing a large dataset with over half a million sales records. The main goal was to find actionable insights, track KPIs, and support AtliQ Hardware in making strategic decisions. The ultimate aim was to enhance the company’s performance, particularly in terms of net sales and gross margins.
